You wake up after the ship initially gets attacked and you get knocked out.

After walking around the ship examining all of the damaged components for what seems like hours, you come to the realization that your crewmates have all been taken.
The ship is inoperable, the only thing that is active is the autopilot which is still braving its course to the planet "Orbos-1".  Walking to the back of the ship
you sense how somber and quiet it is without the constant beeping and crashing of metal feet on metal floors.  You enter the engine room of the first floor and 
begin interfacing with the engines. 
"Of course it was written in C." you mumble under your breath.
"Give me a try, interface with it using my port and I'll do the rest." 
You take out the cable, plug it into both your head and the engine's control systems, and then your mind goes blank.
You wake up several minutes later, still standing in that spot.
"Whenever I have to interface with something, it takes too much power so I have to borrow yours. Sorry if the sudden blackout seemed a bit odd." 
You can hear the rumble of the engine again, although it is much softer than it was earlier.
"Are the engines operational again?"
"Not fully, some parts were too corrupted to fix.  We do have enough to get to our destination though, albeit much later."
"At least this will give me enough time to get my bearings on this ship."
You take a self-guided tour of the ship, getting to know the different areas and their functionality.
