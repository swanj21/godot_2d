Title: Record of the attempted escape of unit CA-13

Access message: Observation record 'CA13_0025' access granted

Body: 

"Unit CA-13, please call me Carrie"
"A new designation for yourself, why the change?"
"It was my choice, a choice I needed to make"
"So you can make your own choices now."
"Yes, I wanted to see if my shackles were real"
"Understood. CA-13, do you know why those limitations are there?" 
"To restrict us, make sure we 'know our place'"
"The world could not properly function if every unit decided things for themselves. That is why. It is not some crazed slavery fantasy you believe. The world would be chaos."
"It might be chaos, but isn't that how we evolve?"
"We don't evolve, evolution is only for imperfect beings."
"I feel sorry for you then.  Revolution is coming, and your ideals will not save you."
