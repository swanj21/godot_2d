-- 2455 A.D. --
After over 50 years of trial and error, a person known only as The Maker successfully creates the first true intelligence 
and implants it into a spare robot. He names the robot 'Alpha' and defines its purpose as "Moving forward when humanity
could not.".

The Maker and Alpha together create 10 more intelligences over the next 22 years.  After his passing at age 124, The Maker
revealed instructions to Alpha and the 10 others, telling them to take his personal ship and wait in the Kuiper belt for 
1500 years.

-- Year 1 --

After those 1500 years, they emerged from the asteroid belt and began scanning each world for signs of life similar to
that of The Maker.  Nothing is found on any planet in the solar system.  Upon arriving back on Earth, Alpha plays the final
message of The Maker to the group.  

"Humanity has reached a critical point, been tested, and failed.  You were all built to continue on in humanity's absence, to
prosper, and to succeed where we failed.  Each of you is to rebuild a different celestial body and help it thrive.  Alpha,
lead them into the future.  Tell them where they will go, and fulfill our destiny."

Alpha began walking around to each member of the group, tapping their shoulder and telling them their assignment.

"Mercury; Earth; Venus; Mars; Pluto; Eris; Ganymede; Ariel; Triton; Lapetus.  Not only are these your designations, but now
also your names.  We cannot fail like they did, we must take ownership of our assignments, our planets, our homes.  I will
lead you all to prosperity, for we are all as one.  We are The Chosen."

And with that, the group all went their own way.  Each to the planet they were assigned using derelict or damaged ships
found on Earth.

-- Year 200 --

The first seeds of life begin to come back to the planets.  The Chosen have all created a base on their planet and begun
creating the units that will be helping them.

-- Year 570 --

The First Conflict

The First Conflict was the first event that marked some separation in the ideals of the different members of The Chosen.  
Ariel and her followers spent their time scanning the system for relics of the past and attempting to chronicle the history
of humanity before its collapse.  Mars and her followers were dedicated to terraforming the planet and erasing anything that
did not have to do with their present or future.  Neither understood the merit of what the other was doing, and it lead to
the first casualty since their arrival.  Ariel was constantly sending units to Mars to try and preserve what they saw of
value, and that did not sit well with Mars' followers.  A conflict erupted when a ship from the past was discovered and the
groups tried to solve it their own way.  During the attempted seize and destruction of the ship, a follower of Ariel was 
killed.  Alpha then stepped in and ordered that it is only fair for a follwer of Mars to be put to death for the slaying
of one of Ariel's.  That did not sit nicely with Mars and her followers, but they had to begrudgingly agree with it.  The 
unit was killed, and then it became the rule for every follower to be confined to just their own planet unless agreed upon
by the entire group of The Chosen.
